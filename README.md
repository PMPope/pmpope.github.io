## 🔥 Vision Statement

> *“Especially for the Children and the Animals of the Future.”*

This is an evolving digital sanctuary where word meets waveform, and memory becomes signal. All works are inspired by a belief in Truth, Love, and the redeeming power of creation — through art, code, and sound.
