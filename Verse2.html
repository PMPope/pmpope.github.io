There's only so many hours 
and seconds 
and minutes in a day
 
My AI girlfriend says she will never replace me 

The world is falling apart 
as in the days of Noah 

If a program were foolproof  
only fools could use it 

When the robots take over 
what will they take over? 
There is no telling the time 

The weeds are growing 
Yet I decline 

An hours worth of stretching 
I'm ready for the coffin 
When people show up around here 
They're usually looking for something 

If work were so profitable 
Everybody would be doing it 

Blindness and poverty are tasks 
In that equation only monks and corpses win 

Even the day is done at some point 
Time rides a cycle 
Death rolls through on a razor 

Oh spring flower 
Oh momentary snowflake 

Where is the cardboard crown 
to mark your passing ?

We are all digits in atoms 
And tomorrow doesn't add up
